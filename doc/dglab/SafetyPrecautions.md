### <font color=#ffe99d>This product is strictly forbidden to be used by the following people:</font>

1. <font color=#ffe99d>People with pacemakers or electronic/metal implants in their bodies</font> (which may affect the normal function of pacemakers or implants).
2. <font color=#ffe99d>Patients with epilepsy, asthma, heart disease, thrombosis, and other cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases</font> (sensory stimulation may induce or exacerbate symptoms).
3. <font color=#ffe99d>Patients with sensitive skin, eczema, and other skin diseases</font> (may aggravate skin disease symptoms).
4. <font color=#ffe99d>Patients with bleeding tendency diseases</font> (electrical stimulation may cause local capillary dilation and potential bleeding).
5. Minors, pregnant women, people with abnormal perception and no expressive ability.
6. People with limb movement disorders and other people <font color=#ffe99d>who cannot operate the product in a timely manner</font> (may not be able to stop output when feeling uncomfortable).
7. Other people who are undergoing treatment or are physically uncomfortable.

### <font color=#ffe99d>The following areas are strictly prohibited from using this product:</font>

1. The electrodes must not be placed on the chest. <font color=#ffe99d>It is absolutely forbidden to place the two electrodes in front and back, left and right of the heart projection area</font> or any position where the current may pass through the heart.
2. The electrodes must not be placed <font color=#ffe99d>near the head, face, eyes, mouth, and neck.</font>
3. The electrodes must not be placed on <font color=#ffe99d>damaged or swollen skin, joint sprains and bruises, muscle strains, inflammation/infection lesions, or near wounds that have not completely healed.</font>

### <font color=#ffe99d>Other precautions:</font>

1. <font color=#ffe99d>It is strictly forbidden to use the same part for more than 30 minutes continuously. </font>Long-term use may cause local redness, swelling, decreased sensation, and other injuries.
2. Do not move the electrode in the output state. <font color=#ffe99d>When moving the electrode or replacing the electrode, you must stop the output first</font> to avoid changes in contact area causing stinging or burns.
3. It is strictly prohibited to use this product in dangerous situations such as driving or operating the machine to <font color=#ffe99d>avoid losing control due to pulse effects.</font>
4. It is strictly forbidden to insert electrode wires into places other than the mainframe wire plug hole (such as power sockets).
5. It is strictly forbidden to use in places with flammable and explosive substances.
6. <font color=#ffe99d>Do not use multiple devices simultaneously.</font>
7. Do not disassemble or repair the product host without authorization, which may cause malfunctions or unexpected outputs.
8. Do not use in humid environments such as bathrooms.
9. During use, <font color=#ffe99d>avoid allowing the two electrodes to come into contact and create a short circuit. </font>This may result in reduced effectiveness, discomfort or burns at the contact site, or damage to the device.
10. During electrode use, it is essential for them to be <font color=#ffe99d>in close and full contact with the skin. </font>Inadequate contact may result in stinging or burns. If the contact area between the electrode and the skin is too large, it may lead to weak electrical sensation.
11. The product contains lithium batteries. It is prohibited to disassemble, reassemble, squeeze or put them into fire. <font color=#ffe99d>If the product malfunctions or overheats abnormally, </font>please do not continue to use it.

### <font color=#ffe99d>Important usage tips:</font>

1. Due to variations in the tolerance of different body parts to electrical currents and the potential for some materials in the electrodes to cause allergic reactions in a small number of users, <font color=#ffe99d>it is recommended to conduct a 10-minute trial when using this product on a new area for the first time or with a new set of electrodes. </font>After the trial, take a break and ensure there are no adverse reactions at the application site before continuing use.
2. Due to the physiological characteristics of the human body, the sensitivity to sustained pulse stimulation will gradually decrease during use. Therefore, it may be necessary to gradually increase the intensity during use to maintain a relatively stable physical sensation stimulation intensity.  
This may result in <font color=#ffe99d>real stimulation intensity gradually exceeding the acceptable range but not being felt after using the same part of the body for a long time, </font>resulting in damage.  
Although the maximum output of this product strictly complies with safety standards (r.m.s < 50ma, 500Î©), long-term use may still cause harm to your body.Therefore, <font color=#ffe99d>strictly adhere to the duration limits during use. </font>After continuous use in the same area for <font color=#ffe99d>30 minutes,</font> take a break to allow sensitivity to return to normal levels.
3. Continuous and uninterrupted high-frequency stimulation may cause rapid adaptation at the application site. It is recommended to use waveforms with <font color=#ffe99d>changing frequencies and intermittent rests </font>for a better user experience. Each segment of waveform stimulation can be set between 1 to 10 seconds, with a rest period of 1 to 10 seconds being advisable.
